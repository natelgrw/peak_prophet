"""
peak_decoder.py

A Python script that utilizes MOCCA2 to create peak decoder objects aiding in the extraction of
peak locations and peak widths in LC-MS ultraviolet and mass spectra. This script is compatible
with raw data files from Agilent, Schimadzu, and Waters machines.

Each peak decoder object contains essential functions to process LC-MS experiment 
files and return a list of peaks represented as tuples of length 2. The first and
second elements represent the starting and ending x coordinates of the peak.

Additionally, other supplemental functions exist to extract chromatogram wavelength
and absorbance data using MOCCA2.
