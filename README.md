# PeakProphet: Automated LC‚ÄìMS Peak Characterization

PeakProphet is an end-to-end pipeline for LC‚ÄìMS peak characterization. It integrates chromatogram processing, product/property prediction, mass spectrometry parsing, and multi-criteria scoring into a unified workflow that maps observed peaks to candidate compounds.

Current Version: **1.0.0**

## üîÆ Prediction Mechanism
- Generates candidate products given reactants and solvent using the ASKCOS web server.
- Predicts retention times using online RT models.
- Predicts Œª<sub>max</sub> using UV‚ÄìVis ML checkpoints.
- Provides unified PredictedProduct and ChemicalReaction classes to organize predicted values.

## üß™ Decoding & MS Utilities
- Process LC‚ÄìUV chromatograms: baseline correction, peak finding, deconvolution.
- Extract peak apexes and Œª<sub>max</sub> at apex.
- Provide plotting utilities for chromatogram visualization.
- Parse mass spectrometry data (.mzML): extract TIC/BPC, pull spectra near target retention times.

## üßÆ Scoring & Assignment
- Score candidates against observed peaks by:
- Retention time (Gaussian kernel).
- Œª<sub>max</sub> (Gaussian kernel).
- MS spectra similarity (cosine similarity).
- Combine feature-level scores into a weighted aggregate.
- Perform optimal assignment of predicted compounds to peaks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

- Python 3.10+
- Conda

Key Dependencies:
- `mocca2` for chromatogram processing and peak extraction
- `playwright` and `pyppeteer` for ASKCOS and RTPred web server automation
- `chemprop` for UVVisML lambda max prediction model operations
- `pymzml` for mass spectra extraction and data processing
- `scipy` for peak assignment and scoring
